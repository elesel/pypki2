Used instructions from https://jamielinux.com/docs/openssl-certificate-authority/create-the-root-pair.html to generate certificates for these tests.  Note that the root certificate is right here for all to see, which would be a huge no no in practice.

Root certificate password = asdf
Intermediate certificate password = qwerty
